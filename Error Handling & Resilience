✅ 1. Implementing Retry & Error Handling in Power Automate.
The flow works just fine, but what happens if it fails? In this article, I will be iterating further the tool built so far by adding scalability and resilience to the product to make it fail proof, and whenever it fails, there is always a message log notifying you.  

*  Configure Retry Policies

1. Go to each action (e.g., “Send email”, “Create item”, “Post message in a chat or channel”).
2. Open the settings (⋯) → Settings → set retry policy to Automatic (4 retries) with exponential intervals.

*  Add a “Scope” Step for Error Logging

1. Wrap your main steps in a Scope action.
2. Add another Scope labeled “On Error” using the “Configure run after” option.
3. Set to run if the main scope fails or is skipped.

*  Log Errors to SharePoint or Teams.

1. Inside the error Scope, add “Create item” in a new SharePoint list (Email Error Logs) or send a Teams message indicating failure.
2. Include dynamic details: Flow name, timestamp, error message.
